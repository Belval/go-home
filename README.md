# go-home

go-home (pun intended) is my personal home automation system. It communicates with custom modules made with ESP8266s to activate relays and transmit temperature, light, movement, and all the data I might need to remotely control my home.

Commands are given through a web interface and transmitted through what I call the "backbone" which is a glorified UDP server.
